<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from Rogers State University May of 1998 with an Associates Degree in Computer Science.  I wound up
  getting hired at Verizon and never furthered my degree.  After my 20+ years experience in Project Management, 
  I've decided to return to my roots and explore Computer Science/Computer Programming again.  I'm just beginning
  but I already feel at home.
